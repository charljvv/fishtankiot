# Cloud Connected Fish tank
## Fishtank IOT hackathon project


- [arduino_module.py](arduino_module.py) is used for querying the arduino module for data from the PH Sensor
- [temp_module.py](temp_module.py) is used for querying the temperature sensors from the One Wire interface
- [fishtank.py](fishtank.py) is used as a wrapper library for calling the functions from arduino_module and temp_module
- [processingLambda.py](lambdas/processingLambda.py) is the python script run on the serverless lambda functions to process sqs data to dynamodb
- [query_cloud.py](query_cloud.py) is an initial proof of concept to manually invoke a function to read the latest data from the SQS queues
- [sensors_to_cloud.py](sensors_to_cloud.py) is the python script to query all the sensors, build a dictionary object to send to the SQS queues. This is run on a cron job on the Raspberry PI.


To run this locally: 
- Make sure the env variable 'DBNAME' is set to your Dynamodb instance name. This is used by all the NodeJS lambdas and the processing lambda
- Enable the One wire interface on the Raspberry Pi (for the temp readings)
- Enable reading from the serial busses (for the Arduino readings)

- Add a cronjob with the following configuration: `1 * * * * python ~/fishtankiot/sensors_to_cloud.py`
